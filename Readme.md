This repo holds several examples of using gRPC. Branches are organized by
problem/topic and solution/topic. You can run the tests in master or
the solution branch to see a working example. Working code is removed
in problem branches so different implementations can be worked through.
For example, checkout to create your own implementation following Test 
Driven Development
```
git checkout problem/call-types
```

## Call Types
Run 
[TestGrpcCallTypes](src/test/java/com/baeldung/grpc/calls/TestGrpcCallTypes.java)
to see the different examples in action.

Lastly this is code is based on code from [baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-grpc-streaming)
